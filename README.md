# parcial_ML_2023-3

This repo contains the solution for the machine learning final test taken at Univerdad del Norte in october 2023.

Here i solved a classification and a regression problem for one dataset each, also, hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation is performed. Of course an exploratory data analysis is also performed to each dataset.
